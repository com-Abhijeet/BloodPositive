Pan-India Blood Group Database Project

1. Problem Statement

Blood donation during emergencies often faces delays due to the inability to quickly locate matching donors. Existing platforms either lack real-time location-based search or compromise privacy by exposing personal contact details. This project aims to bridge the gap by creating a secure, user-friendly mobile app to connect users with nearby individuals having the required blood group, ensuring privacy through in-app calling.

2. Stakeholders

Primary Users: Individuals needing blood or willing to donate.

Hospitals & NGOs: To facilitate quick donor search.

Project Owner: Solo fresher developer.

App Stores: Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

3. Project Requirements

3.1 Functional Requirements

User registration via OTP or Google OAuth.

Profile creation with blood group, contact details, and address.

Location-based search for matching blood groups.

In-app calling to contact donors without sharing personal numbers.

Push notifications for requests and matches.

User dashboard for profile management.

3.2 Non-functional Requirements
